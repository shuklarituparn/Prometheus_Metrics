Google's four golden signals for system reliability


1. Latency: How much time your service is taking to fulfill a request
2. Traffic: How many requests are made to the service
3. Saturation: How saturated the service is (for example how many percent of cpu are you using)
4. Errors: How many requests out of the total is returned with errors
